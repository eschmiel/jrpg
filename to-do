- make spinning slots for slot machine
- trigger spinning on button push
- stop spinning after a timer
- make an image spin on the spinner and change after each rotation
- title screen -> game screen

- different coins you can use to start spins with different danger levels
- add more damage options
- different spinner options with different results. Kind of a deck builder thing?

title -> intro -> choose what to put in the spin hopper -> spin mode. Choose danger coins and run spinner

coins could actively change result pool mid spin round.

coin ideas
- double rewards but add a threat.
